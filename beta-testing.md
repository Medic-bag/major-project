# Beta Testing

## CS Person
- Wish there was a macro for ‘2’
- Wish I could move towers after selecting the tower
- Wish I knew what button corresponded to each tower
- Wish towers had a description 
- Options menu
- 144 hz option
- More intuitive placement. Like make place on left click
- Make instructions on how to play game
- Add an option to speed up the game
- Show tower prices 
- Have towers labeled
- Unbind remove from right click
- Add awesome base line like from Arctic Monkeys as soundtrack, or bossa nova music


## Non-CS Person
- Would like the goal to be more clear
- Would like if there was music
- The towers and enemies seem basic looking
- The enemies are slow; rounds take a while
- Game feels empty without sfx
