# Reflection

## What Advice Would We Give Ourselves?
- For loops are your best friend. The path can be a for loop.
- Make sure you really understand classes as not to waste time.
- Stop spelling stuff wrong.
- Use p5.collide2d sooner.

## Did We Complete the Need to Haves?
- We completed all of our need to haves and the game works to our liking.

## What Was the Hardest Part of the Project?
- The hardest part of the project was the tower targeting. It took many iterations to get a semi working result and in the end we had to ask Mr. Schellenberg.
- Another difficult part was finding where to start. Starting on classes was fine but didn't have a visual result, starting on the path was tedious and took a while but had a visual result in the sketch.

## Were There Any Problems That We Could Not Solve?
- We couldn't figure out how to get our towers to target enemies properly. Thankfully Mr. Schellenberg figured out the problem.
